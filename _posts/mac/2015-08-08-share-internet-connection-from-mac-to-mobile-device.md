[Reverse Tether - Share OSX Yosemite Wifi Connection Over Bluetooth](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/180578/reverse-tether-share-osx-yosemite-wifi-connection-over-bluetooth)

In order to do this in Yosemite, you'll need to go back to the main screen of System Preferences and click on the `Sharing` preference pane. In the sidebar, there will be an Internet Sharing option. Click on this to view its settings.

Now set the "Share your connection from" drop down to `Wi-Fi` and then check the `Bluetooth PAN` checkbox in the menu below. Next just make sure to check the box next Internet Sharing in the sidebar.

Once this is done your Mac should be sharing its Wi-Fi connection to devices in your Bluetooth PAN.
