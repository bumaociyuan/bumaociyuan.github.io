[oh-my-zsh issue 2654](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/2654)

@tomduncalf's answer

```
I found a fix for this issue over at the iTerm 2 issue tracker: https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/issues/detail?id=2000 - basically, go to Preferences -> Profile -> Keys and load the "xterm with numeric keypad" preset. Not sure why this isn't the default!
